## Launch and Earth Orbit
<br>
<div class="pswp-gallery" id="my-gallery">
The mission begins with the launch of the <a href="/assets/img/apollo/large/saturn_large.jpg" data-pswp-width="1448" data-pswp-height="2048" target="_blank">Saturn V</a> rocket from Kennedy Space Center, and the first phase involves reaching a parking orbit around Earth at an altitude of about 185 kilometers. During the flight, the first (S-IC) and then the second (S-II) rocket stages are detached. After steering the third stage (S-IVB) into the parking orbit, its engine is shut down. This entire process takes about 12 minutes. In the following 1 hour and 20 minutes, the spacecraft orbits around Earth. During this, systems are checked and the spacecraft is oriented for the correct trajectory to the Moon (as a preparation for TLI - Trans Lunar Injection).

## TLI -Trans Lunar Injection and Coast to the Moon
Approximately after one orbit around Earth, the third stage (S-IVB) of the Saturn V rocket is reignited, propelling the spacecraft out of Earth's orbit and towards the Moon (TLI - Trans Lunar Injection). After the burn concludes (~ 5 minutes), the Command and Service Module (CSM) separates from the third stage, rotates in space, and begins the docking maneuver. The goal is to connect with the Lunar Module (LM), which is still housed within the third stage of the Saturn V rocket. Following successful docking, the CSM-LM assembly detaches from the third stage. The combined CSM-LM spacecraft then continues on its own towards the Moon. It is controlled by onboard computers with occasional corrective burns from the service module. The journey to the Moon takes an additional 62 hours.

## LOI - Lunar Orbit Insertion and Descent Preparation
Upon reaching the Moon, the crew ignites the service module engine and begins a braking maneuver to enter into an orbital path around the Moon - known as LOI - Lunar Orbit Insertion. Afterwards, the crew starts preparations for the descent to the lunar surface. Systems are checked, the LM is activated, the crew enters the LM, and finally, the LM is detached from the CSM. This entire phase lasts several hours, during which the combined CSM-LM assembly orbits the Moon several times.

## Lunar Module Descent and Landing
The LM separates from the CSM module, the engine on the LM ignites, and a roughly 12-minute descent to the Moon's surface begins, guided by a combination of onboard computers and manual piloting by the astronauts.

## Surface Operations and Departure from the Moon
In this phase, there are the most differences among the various Apollo missions. However, all missions conducted at least one EVA, collected samples, took photographs, and installed scientific experiments. While Apollo 11 stayed on the lunar surface for about 21 hours, missions Apollo 16 and 17 stayed for more than 70 hours. Unlike the single EVA of Apollo 11, Apollos 15-17 conducted three EVAs each. Eventually, all missions launched from the Moon to re-dock with the Command Service Module (CSM), which remained in lunar orbit.

## TEI - Trans Earth Injection and Return Coast
After the successful rendezvous and docking of the CSM with the LM, the lunar samples and other equipment are transferred to the command module. Then, the ascent stage of the LM is jettisoned, and preparations for the TEI - Trans Earth Injection begin. After correctly orienting the CSM module, the service module's engine is reignited (~ 2 minutes) for the final departure from lunar orbit. The journey back to Earth begins, lasting about 90 hours. At the end of this journey, the service module and command module separate. The command module is then oriented for re-entry into the atmosphere, targeting a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.
